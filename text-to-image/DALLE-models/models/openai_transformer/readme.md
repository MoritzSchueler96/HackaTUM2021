### Pretrained DALLE-pytorch models using *Open-AI transformer*

Here you can upload (e.g. on mega.nz, depositfiles, zippyshare, dropbox, google drive, onedrive, ...) your pretrained dalle models. 
Please use the provided naming convention (https://github.com/robvanvolt/DALLE-models/blob/main/README.md), add the hyperparameters used and ideally also the quality of image generation, which makes continuing training feasible for everyone.
