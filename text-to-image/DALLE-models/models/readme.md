## Folder of pretrained DALLE-pytorch models

Here you can upload (e.g. on mega.nz, depositfiles, zippyshare, dropbox, google drive, onedrive, ...) your pretrained dalle models.
Please use the provided naming convention (https://github.com/robvanvolt/DALLE-models/blob/main/README.md), which makes conintuing training feasible.

Currently we have three folders each corresponding to the transformer used for the Dall-E-model:

* taming transformer
* open-ai transformer
* custom transformer*

*provide a link to the transformer used if you upload a model in this section
